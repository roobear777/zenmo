# Contributing to Zenmo

## For Team Members (Marc & Frankie)

### First Time Setup

1. Make sure you have Flutter installed:
```bash
flutter doctor
```

2. Clone the repository (you'll get the URL from Ru)

3. Get dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Working on Features

1. Always start from the latest `main`:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2. Create your feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b your-name/feature-description
```

3. Make your changes, test locally:
```bash
flutter run
```

4. Commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Clear description of what you built"
git push origin your-name/feature-description
```

5. Open a Pull Request for Ru to review

### Best Practices

- Keep commits focused and descriptive
- Test your changes before pushing
- Don't commit directly to `main`
- Ask questions in PR comments if unsure
- Pull latest changes regularly to avoid conflicts

### Need Help?

Reach out to Ru if you run into issues with Git, Flutter, or the codebase.
